Tempo
=====

A simple iOS app which tells you the BPM of you tapping the screen. Usable for finding out the tempo of some music.

## Features
- Tap repeatedy (with 1 finger) to get the BPM
- Tap with 2 fingers to reset
- Dark screen so you can use it in the club

## ToDo
- Better averaging (maybe removing min/max?)
- Only consider the last $timeframe (?)

## Fancy Futureâ„¢ ToDo
- Use the mic and some BPM detection library. Maybe.
