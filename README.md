Tempo
=====

A simple iOS app which tells you the BPM of you tapping the screen. Usable for
finding out the tempo of some music.

## Features
- Tap repeatedy (with 1 finger) to get the BPM
- Tap with 2 fingers to reset
- Dark screen so you can use it in da clubâ„¢

## ToDo
- [x] Better averaging (maybe removing min/max?)
- [x] Only consider the last ~$timeframe~ 3 seconds
- [ ] Use the mic and some BPM detection library. ~Maybe.~ WIP: See
[audio](https://github.com/0bmxa/Tempo/tree/audio) branch.
