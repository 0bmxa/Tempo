# Tempo: How to use

Tempo let's you quickly & easily determine the pace of a song by tapping your
phone's screen to the beat.

To use Tempo, all you need is to hear (or feel) the beat of a song, and tap the
screen to it. It does not require access to your microphone, nor internet, or
anything else. It simply relies on you tapping the screen.

A few basic usage tips:
- Try tapping the screen evenly and don't follow any fancy drum or instrument
patterns.
- Don't worry if you can't manage to tap it it too evenly. Tempo smooths your
taps after a few seconds to provide you a stable & reliable result.
- To reset, just tap the screen with two fingers, and it will go back to zero.
Or just wait and start tapping later. If you made a break, Tempo will only use
the most recent taps, and ignore old ones.
