# Tempo Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2020-02-20_

The Tempo app collects absolutely no data from you. Not even your taps or the
resulting BPM are saved anywhere.

Also, it uses no tracking or anything similar, and does not access the network
at all.

It's really only between you and your phone.

If you have any concerns, check out the source code of this app
[on GitHub](https://github.com/0bmxa/Tempo) and create an issue.
